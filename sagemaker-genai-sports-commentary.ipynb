    "# Generate Personalized Sports Commentary Using Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations in Sports industry are harnessing the power of AI to help bring better experience to fans who engage the sports throughout the events. With latest developments in technology, the expectations of sports fans are also evolving. Fans are more immersed in rich and personalized experiences by engaging with the games on-the-go with their smartphones. The need was felt for truly unique, live sports experiences that went beyond the usual routine of watching the games on live TV or streaming devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to engaging sports fans, Sportscasters provides analysis by condensing live information into interesting and relevant summaries. However, given the increasing amount of data collected and analyzed in the games, it becomes a challenging task to distill the information into summaries that are most relevant to the individuals. In sports reporting, the delivery of commentaries which turns data into engaging stories could drastically enhance the fan experiences. For instance, using a particular commentary style. or a particular language that the fans speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thatâ€™s where AI Natural Language Generation can be helpful in this area. With Foundation Models, which are trained on trillion corpus of words, we can now take the live data collected at the stadiums, and use the models to generate commentaries in variety of styles and languages to meet individual fan preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the capability, we'll use a foundation model to generate sports commentaries. Additionally, we'll use a sample dataset to provide the model with contextual information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the specific artifacts to be used throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset: NFL dataset provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)\n",
    "* Foundation model: [A121 Jurassic-2 Jumbo Instruct](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-f4y5ksmu5kccy)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a new SageMaker endpoint using a J2 Instruct model \n",
    "2. Iterate each row in the CSV data; create a prompt based on the type of play\n",
    "3. Create a prompt by augmenting specifial instructions, such as style, language and so forth. \n",
    "4. Delete the endpoint."
